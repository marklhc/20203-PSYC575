## Course Description
  
This is a graduate-level class in statistical methods on multilevel modeling, a popular technique in behavioral and social science research. The course covers topics in multilevel modeling including two- and three-level hierarchical linear models (HLM), random intercepts and slopes, longitudinal models and growth curve models, as well as some recent development in multilevel modeling.

The course begins with a brief overview of the ubiquity of multilevel data and the problems of using conventional methods to handle such data and then transitions to the conceptual and statistical foundations of two-level multilevel models. Students will be exposed to real data examples and are required to perform analyses using real data of their own or that the instructor provides. Later material covers the use of multilevel modeling as a general framework for longitudinal data analysis, and other modeling considerations such as categorical data, three-level and non-hierarchical (e.g., cross-classified) data structure, multivariate models, and study designs. Students are also encouraged to provide input in suggesting topics to be covered for this course.

## Learning Objectives
  
After the successful completion of this course, students will be able to . . .

1. Articulate the problems of analyzing clustered data with multiple regression/ANOVA;
2. Distinguish between different multilevel data structures;
3. Describe the statistical and conceptual foundations of multilevel modeling;
4. Independently perform multilevel analyses covered in this class using statistical software on real data;
5. Conduct a research project involving multilevel modeling, and effectively communicate their findings/products in an oral presentation as well as in a written report.

**Prerequisite(s):** PSYC 503: Regression and the General Linear Model (or a similar regression class)

**Co-Requisite(s):** None

**Concurrent Enrollment:** None

**Recommended Preparation** : Experience with statistical software (preferably R)

## Course Notes

For class sessions, students are expected to finish the reading assignments before class and actively participate in class discussions and activities. A typical class meeting will include lectures and small-group discussions/activities. This class also includes lab sessions for software demonstrations and for students to work on assignments. Lecture slides/notes will be posted on Blackboard before class meetings, but please note that the lecture slides only serve to guide class discussions and cannot replace the assigned readings. Students are expected to bring their own laptop to class to follow the software demonstration and work on assignments during lab sessions.

## Communication

```
Communication and Technology Policies differ from university policies in that they are course-specific and set by each instructor.  Common course-specific policies the instructor will need to create cover communication, in-class work, late work, and technology.  CET provides a resource for producing equitable course policies.

## Technological Proficiency and Hardware/Software Required
  
You will need to use R (or other statistical software upon approval from the instructor) to complete the assignments and project.

## Description and Assessment of Assignments
  
1. Participation (0%). Students are expected to come to class and lab sessions, actively participate in class discussions and activities.
2. Homework assignments (60%). There will be seven assignments for you to apply the concepts and techniques discussed in class to analytic problems. The first assignment asks you to search and review an article using multilevel modeling, whereas subsequent assignments typically involve performing data analyses using data sets of your own or provided by the instructor, and interpreting the results with some guided questions. Detailed instruction for each assignment will be provided on Blackboard at least a week before the assignment due date. Your must submit your work electronically to Blackboard by 10:00 a.m. Pacific time on the assigned due date (i.e., before the Thursday class starts). Late assignments will not be accepted without prior approval by the instructor.
3. Final project (40%; 5% prospectus, 15% presentation, 20% final paper). You will complete a research project related to multilevel modeling, typically a research report of an empirical study using real data or a theoretical/methodological paper about certain aspects of multilevel modeling. Students interested in project ideas other than an empirical research report (e.g., software package development, systematic review/meta-analysis) are encouraged to discuss their ideas with the instructor.

Suggested topics:
- Using AIC to decide whether a level of clustering is needed
- Demonstration paper of Bayesian model averaging
- Application of Bayesian location-scale modeling

Each of you can choose to work by yourself or work with a partner. Each student/group should schedule to meet with the instructor to talk about their project during week 9 (March 4–8).

There are three grading components for your final project:
  
- Prospectus (5%)  
A prospectus about your project should be submitted by Thursday, February 28, 2019. The prospectus should contain a concise description of what you (or your group) plan to do for your project, including a preliminary plan for statistical analysis. The prospectus should be limited to 1 single-spaced page (excluding references).

- Project Presentation (15%)  
During the last three class meetings (4/23, 4/25, and 4/30), each group will give a 15-minute presentation (including Q&amp;A) on their project. The final presentation should include the following four sections: introduction, method, results, and discussion, or something comparable for methodological or theoretical work. A grading rubric on the research presentation will be posted on Blackboard.

- Final Paper (20%)  
The final paper for each group will be due Tuesday, May 7, 2019, at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time (which is the assigned exam time for the class). Your final paper should incorporate feedback received from the instructor and peers regarding your project presentation. The final paper should include four sections: introduction, method, results, and discussion, or comparable sections. The final paper should be 8-15 double-spaced pages of text (i.e., excluding title page, abstract, references, tables, figures, and appendices).

## Grading Breakdown

B+ 85-88  
B 81-84  
B- 77-80  
C+ 73-76  
C 70-72

## Assignment Submission
  
The assignments should be submitted through Blackboard by Thursday at 10:00 a.m. Pacific time, before the class starts.

Use RStudio Cloud?

## Grading Timeline
  
  Generally, all graded work will be returned no later than two weeks from the submission deadline.

## Late work
  
In general, late work will not be accepted. In rare, exceptional circumstances (where appropriate documentation is provided within 7 days), the assignments may be accepted late at the sole discretion of the instructor. Please obtain prior, written consent if possible.

## Technology in the classroom
  
Phones

Your phone should be turned off or in silent mode (not on vibrate), and should not be used in the classroom.

Tablets and Laptops

During lecture time in the classroom, students can use tablets and laptops only for purposes of viewing course materials and taking notes. Use of tablets and laptops for note taking is strongly discouraged as recent research (Mueller &amp; Oppenheimer, 2014) has shown that note-taking by handwriting is better than typing for improving conceptual learning, and use of such devices may distract both yourself and your peers (Sana, Weston, &amp; Cepeda, 2013). During lab sessions, students should use their laptops to follow the software demonstration and work on assignments during lab sessions.

## Attendance
  
Students are expected to attend all class and lab sessions on time.
